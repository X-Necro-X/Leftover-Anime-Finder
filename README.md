# Leftover-Anime-Finder
## What is this?
- In the vast and captivating world of anime, it's common to start new series while putting the remaining seasons of the current one on hold. However, this backlog of anime can quickly become an ever-expanding maze, making it challenging to keep tabs on what's left, even with the aid of tracking websites.
- Adding to this challenge, sometimes we wrap up our favorite anime proudly stating the we've watched everything it has to offer, only to discover years later, in an Instagram reel, that we have missed out a few specials or OVAs.

Imagine having a handy solution that automatically compiles a concise list of all the stuff that is still awaiting your attention. Enter this Python script. Simply input your [Anilist](https://anilist.co/) ID and watch this script as it diligently sifts through your watched and ongoing anime, generating a list of the remaining seasons, specials, movies, and other related content that are patiently queued up.

## Disclaimer
- [Anilist](https://anilist.co/) account is needed.
- Too lazy to generate an exe file, so you should have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed in your system to run this.

## How to use?
- Begin by acquiring the script file named "main.py." Once in your grasp, run it.
- The script will eagerly request your Anilist ID; feed it. [How to get Anilist ID?](https://anilist.co/activity/640286132).
- With your Anilist ID in hand, the script will embark on its journey. Watch it reveal the list of related content for each anime in your collection.
- When the curtain falls, a new file, named "Leftovers.txt", will be created in the same directory. Inside, you'll find the list of all the content left to explore.

### Impatient for the Script?
No problem! You can start and stop it as you please, whenever you please. The script remembers where it left off. When you're ready to continue, it picks up right from where you left it. PS: Just dont delete the txt files named `DO_NOT_REMOVE`.
